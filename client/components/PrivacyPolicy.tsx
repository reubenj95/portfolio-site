              This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) describes how Reuben
              Hawthorne-Jensen (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or
              &quot;our&quot;) collects, uses, shares, and protects personal
              information obtained from visitors to the website
              [https://reubenhawthornejensen.dev] (&quot;Website&quot;). Please
              read this Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding
              your personal information and how we will treat it.

            <p>
              <strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We collect personal information from users when they voluntarily
              provide it in the course of using our applications. The types of
              personal information collected may include names, email addresses,
              and other information provided by users through user input.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Information Collection Methods</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Personal information is collected through user input within our
              applications. In some cases, if users choose OAuth verification,
              personal information may be collected from third-party
              applications selected by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Purpose of Collection</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We collect personal information for demonstration and educational
              purposes, allowing users to view our work and understand our
              capabilities as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We use cookies for the storage of temporary information about the
              user, primarily for authorization and general analytics purposes.
              These cookies do not store any personal information and are used
              to enhance the user experience, such as remembering preferences
              for sort order of items or keeping a user logged in. We also use
              Google Analytics to track website performance and user engagement.
              The analytics data is anonymized and used for tracking and
              improving the overall performance of the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Personal information provided during the registration process
              through third-party services (such as Auth0, AWS) will be managed
              directly by those providers. Any other third-party applications
              used within our projects will be responsible for the proper
              management of the information they collect. Please refer to the
              respective third-party providers&apos; privacy policies for more
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data Security</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We employ best practices for encryption of servers and transfer
              protocols to protect the personal information collected from our
              users. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information
              provided in the use of our applications. Users should refrain from
              providing sensitive information, as it is not required to utilize
              the applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Opt-Out and Unsubscribe</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not send out communications to users. Opt-out options are
              not provided for anonymized tracking. Please note that opting out
              of tracking may affect certain functionalities of the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Minors</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our applications are intended for users above the age of 18. We do
              not verify users&apos; age, and it is the responsibility of
              parents and caregivers to ensure minors do not provide sensitive
              information through our applications. If we become aware of any
              sensitive information about minors posted on our applications, we
              will promptly remove the information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data Retention</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not guarantee the retention of information entered into our
              applications for an extended period. Data will be periodically
              purged from the database to improve application performance and
              reduce hosting costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Requests</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Users can contact us through the contact form on our Website to
              make requests regarding their personal information. While we will
              do our best to accommodate user requests, we reserve the right to
              permanently remove all information from the relevant application
              instead of providing a comprehensive list of the information.
              Please note that no personally identifiable information will be
              held unless directly and knowingly provided by the user. In cases
              where safety concerns or legal proceedings require access to this
              information, we will cooperate to the best of our abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Disclaimer</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              This Website is not a commercial project. Users enter information
              at their own risk. While we strive to be responsible hosts and
              manage user information properly, the purpose of the applications
              is to demonstrate our abilities rather than provide a service.
              Therefore, users are not required to provide privileged
              information during the use of the applications. If users choose to
              provide such information, we cannot guarantee its complete
              security, nor can we guarantee the absence of a breach unless we
              have been notified of one.
